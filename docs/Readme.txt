Building the Decoda Documentation
----------------------------------------------

To build the documentation, you must have the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop
installed.

You can download the installer from here:
	http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-C8A6-452F-9AA0-D597D16580CC&displaylang=en

HTML Help Workshop should be installed to the default location c:\Program
Files\HTML Help Workshop

The documentation is built by running the build.bat batch file. If successful,
Decoda.chm will be generated in the output directory.  Note that if Decoda.chm
is currently open in the help viewer, the file cannot be updated.
